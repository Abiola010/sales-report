**Introduction**

In the context of becoming a data analyst, Microsoft Excel isn't the only tool used for analysis and visualization; Microsoft Power Business Intelligence (Power BI) is also a crucial tool used by data analysts.

According to Wikipedia, Power BI is an interactive data visualization software application developed by Microsoft with a primary focus on business intelligence. It's a component of the Microsoft Power Platform. Power BI is a set of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to transform disparate data sources into cohesive, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Data can be obtained by reading directly from a database, a webpage, or structured files such as spreadsheets, CSVs, XMLs, and JSONs.

In addition to a desktop-based interface named "Power BI Desktop," Power BI offers cloud-based BI (business intelligence) services under the name "Power BI Services." It provides data warehouse functionality such as data preparation, data discovery, and interactive dashboards. Microsoft launched Power BI Embedded on the Azure cloud platform in March 2016. The ability to import bespoke visualizations is one of the product's key differentiators.
