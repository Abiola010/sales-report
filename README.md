**Introduction**

In the context of becoming a data analyst, Microsoft Excel isn't the only tool used for analysis and visualization; Microsoft Power Business Intelligence (Power BI) is also a crucial tool used by data analysts.

According to Wikipedia, Power BI is an interactive data visualization software application developed by Microsoft with a primary focus on business intelligence. It's a component of the Microsoft Power Platform. Power BI is a set of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to transform disparate data sources into cohesive, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Data can be obtained by reading directly from a database, a webpage, or structured files such as spreadsheets, CSVs, XMLs, and JSONs.

In addition to a desktop-based interface named "Power BI Desktop," Power BI offers cloud-based BI (business intelligence) services under the name "Power BI Services." It provides data warehouse functionality such as data preparation, data discovery, and interactive dashboards. Microsoft launched Power BI Embedded on the Azure cloud platform in March 2016. The ability to import bespoke visualizations is one of the product's key differentiators.

Power BI's original version was built on the Microsoft Excel add-ins Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power View. Microsoft also introduced many other features over time, such as Question and Answers, enterprise-level data integration, and security choices via Power BI Gateways. On July 24, 2015, Power BI was made available to the general public for the first time. It offers desktop, web, and mobile app versions, among others.

The following are key components of the Power BI ecosystem:
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop: The Windows desktop program for PCs and desktops is mostly used for developing and publishing reports to the Service.
- Microsoft Power BI Service: The internet service is SaaS-based (software as a service). This was previously known as Power BI for Office 365, but it is now known as PowerBI.com, or just Power BI.
- Mobile Power BI Apps:Power BI Mobile applications are available for Android, iOS, and Windows phones and tablets. (From Microsoft Power BI (2023, February 3)) Microsoft Power BI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft Power BI).
